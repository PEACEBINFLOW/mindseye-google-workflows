# Event Types – MindsEye Google Workflows

A catalog of valid `trigger.type` and `trigger.event` patterns.

This is mostly for naming consistency across workflows.

---

## 1. Trigger types

- `manual`  
  Explicit CLI/UI call. Example: “run devlog for last 7 days”.

- `manual_or_scheduled`  
  Can be called by a person or a schedule. Example: orchestrator run.

- `scheduled`  
  Pure cron/time based triggers. Example: daily analytics refresh.

- `workspace_event`  
  Events coming from Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs, Drive, Forms, Calendar).

- `conceptual`  
  Non-executable, just a diagram/overview.

---

## 2. Workspace events (examples)

These are **logical names**; actual technical events depend on Apps Script / APIs.

- `gmail.message.labeled`
  - A Gmail message/thread got a label (e.g. `MindsEye-*`).

- `docs.menu.review_requested`
  - User clicked “MindsEye → Review with MindsEye” in a Google Doc.

- `drive.folder.scheduled_summary`
  - Time-based trigger that runs a folder summary job.

- `forms.response.submitted`
  - New Google Forms response (for prompt intake).

- `calendar.event.created` (future)
  - New calendar event that might be linked to a node.

---

## 3. Ledger events (internal)

These events aren’t from Google directly, but from intermediate steps:

- `ledger.node.created`
- `ledger.node.updated`
- `ledger.run.created`
- `ledger.run.updated`

These can be used as triggers for:

- Devlog generation
- Analytics recalculation
- Notification flows

---

## 4. Devlog / Analytics events

- `devlog.window.generated`
  - A devlog markdown file has been produced for a given window.

- `analytics.refresh.completed`
  - Analytics exports, stats, and charts have been refreshed.

---

## 5. Naming conventions

- Use dot notation from **general → specific**:  
  `surface.entity.action` or `domain.entity.action`.

- Keep them **implementation-agnostic**:  
  we don’t tie them to exact Google API method names here — just behavior.

These event labels are for humans + high-level YAML;  
each repo maps them to the actual APIs / Apps Script triggers.
